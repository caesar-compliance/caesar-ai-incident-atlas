# Next Actions — caesar-ai-incident-atlas

**Last updated:** 19 May 2026

---

## Execution Boundaries

This repository is in the **dataset MVP — public readiness review complete** phase. T011 confirmed all 10 records are ready with caveats. No product code, no scraper, no CLI, no static site, no database, no package managers, and no dependencies until T012 is approved.

The v0.2 draft contract is stable. See `V0_2_DRAFT_PRODUCT_CONTRACT.md` before starting any implementation work.

The clean-room policy is active. See `CLEAN_ROOM_IMPLEMENTATION_POLICY.md` and `LOCAL_ARCHITECTURE_MINING_PLAN.md` before studying any external source.

The T004 preparation documents are now complete. See `DATASET_MVP_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, `FIRST_INCIDENT_SELECTION_CRITERIA.md`, `SOURCE_VERIFICATION_WORKFLOW.md`, and `LICENSE_AND_SOURCE_SAFETY_CHECKLIST.md` before starting any incident curation work.

## Next Recommended Step: T012

**T012 — Minimal Static Site Architecture Plan or Minimal Static Site Prototype.**

Only after explicit Control Tower review of T011 findings. See `MINIMAL_STATIC_SITE_SCOPE_DRAFT.md` for options A/B/C.

### T012 pre-conditions

1. Control Tower reviews `DATASET_MVP_PUBLIC_READINESS_REVIEW.md` and confirms readiness.
2. Control Tower confirms T012 scope (plan only / prototype / combined).
3. Draft sector IDs labelling strategy confirmed.
4. T012 formally initiated by Control Tower.

### T012 constraints

- No scraping, database, admin UI, external data import, or public deployment.
- No server-side runtime.
- No new incident records beyond INC-0010 without further CT approval.
- Any static site build must not be publicly deployed without a further explicit CT approval step.

## Pending License Verifications (Before v0.3)

The following license verifications must be completed before incident records citing these sources can be created:

| Source | Pages to verify | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| OECD AI Incidents Monitor | https://oecd.ai/terms and https://www.oecd.org/en/about/terms-conditions.html | High |
| AIAAIC Repository | https://www.aiaaic.org/aiaaic-repository/user-guide | High |
| MIT AI Incident Tracker | https://airisk.mit.edu/ | Medium |

AIID (CC BY-SA 4.0) and IBM AI Atlas Nexus (Apache-2.0) are verified. See `LICENSE_AND_SOURCE_SAFETY_CHECKLIST.md` for details.

---

## Safe Autonomous Tasks

The following tasks can be executed autonomously without Control Tower approval:

- Improving documentation formatting and clarity.
- Fixing typos or broken links in documentation.
- Updating REPO_INVENTORY.md when new files are added.
- Updating CHANGELOG.md with accurate entries.
- Completing a THIRD_PARTY_REPOSITORY_REVIEW_TEMPLATE.md for a source already listed in the register.
- Completing pending license verifications and recording findings in LICENSE_AND_SOURCE_SAFETY_CHECKLIST.md and THIRD_PARTY_CODE_AND_LICENSE_REGISTER.md.

---

## Tasks Requiring Control Tower Approval

The following tasks require Artem / Control Tower review before execution:

- Starting T012 (requires Control Tower approval of T011 findings).
- Starting v0.3 Dataset MVP.
- Implementing any product code (scripts, automated tooling, application features).
- Creating any incident records.
- Selecting incident sources and verifying data licenses.
- Choosing the static site generator technology.
- Any cross-repository changes or integrations.
- Any reuse of third-party code or data.

---

## Blocked Tasks

- v0.3 Dataset MVP — blocked until T006 dossier shortlist is approved.
- Incident record creation — blocked until T006 is approved and workflow gates are passed.
- Any mass import or scraping workflow — blocked unless separately approved.

---

## Cross-Repository Coordination Notes

- Incident export format must be compatible with `caesar-ai-evidence` incident-mapping schema. Maintain compatibility in future schema updates.
- T005 schema/taxonomy files exist; keep changes backward-compatible unless a new decision is approved.
- Future Governance OS integration requires stable incident IDs (INC-0001 format) and taxonomy IDs — locked in v0.2 contract.
- Do not edit `caesar-ai-evidence` or any sibling repository from this repository.
- AIID CC BY-SA 4.0 ShareAlike clause must be reviewed before any direct AIID data import. See `LICENSE_AND_SOURCE_SAFETY_CHECKLIST.md` section 2.1.
