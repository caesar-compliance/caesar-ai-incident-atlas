# Next Actions — caesar-ai-incident-atlas

**Last updated:** 19 May 2026

---

## Execution Boundaries

This repository is in the **public deployment plan complete** phase. T016 defined the deployment plan, hosting options, publication risk gate, and T017 recommendation. Public deployment requires CT hosting decision, legal/license review completion, and explicit CT approval.

The v0.2 draft contract is stable. See `V0_2_DRAFT_PRODUCT_CONTRACT.md` before starting any implementation work.

The clean-room policy is active. See `CLEAN_ROOM_IMPLEMENTATION_POLICY.md` and `LOCAL_ARCHITECTURE_MINING_PLAN.md` before studying any external source.

The T004 preparation documents are now complete. See `DATASET_MVP_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, `FIRST_INCIDENT_SELECTION_CRITERIA.md`, `SOURCE_VERIFICATION_WORKFLOW.md`, and `LICENSE_AND_SOURCE_SAFETY_CHECKLIST.md` before starting any incident curation work.

## Next Recommended Step: T017

**T017 — Deployment Configuration.**

Only after CT resolves the following:

1. CT reviews `PUBLICATION_RISK_GATE.md` and `HOSTING_OPTION_MATRIX.md`.
2. CT selects hosting option (GitHub Pages / Cloudflare Pages / Netlify / VPS).
3. CT confirms public URL (e.g. `incidents.caesar.no`).
4. Legal and license review formally completed (PUBLICATION_RISK_GATE G-01, G-02).
5. CT issues explicit initiation of T017.

### T017 scope

- Implement data path fix (`data/` → `site/data/`, update `app.js` constants).
- Implement hosting config for selected option only.
- Run final browser smoke test.
- Await CT `"Approve public deployment"` before activating.

### T017 must NOT

- Deploy publicly without CT issuing `"Approve public deployment"`.
- Add new incident records.
- Add npm, framework, backend, or database.
- Commit secrets or credentials.

See `T017_DEPLOYMENT_IMPLEMENTATION_RECOMMENDATION.md` for the full step-by-step plan.

## Pending License Verifications (Before v0.3)

The following license verifications must be completed before incident records citing these sources can be created:

| Source | Pages to verify | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| OECD AI Incidents Monitor | https://oecd.ai/terms and https://www.oecd.org/en/about/terms-conditions.html | High |
| AIAAIC Repository | https://www.aiaaic.org/aiaaic-repository/user-guide | High |
| MIT AI Incident Tracker | https://airisk.mit.edu/ | Medium |

AIID (CC BY-SA 4.0) and IBM AI Atlas Nexus (Apache-2.0) are verified. See `LICENSE_AND_SOURCE_SAFETY_CHECKLIST.md` for details.

## Safe Autonomous Tasks

The following tasks can be executed autonomously without Control Tower approval:

- Improving documentation formatting and clarity.
- Fixing typos or broken links in documentation.
- Updating REPO_INVENTORY.md when new files are added.
- Updating CHANGELOG.md with accurate entries.
- Completing a THIRD_PARTY_REPOSITORY_REVIEW_TEMPLATE.md for a source already listed in the register.
- Completing pending license verifications and recording findings in LICENSE_AND_SOURCE_SAFETY_CHECKLIST.md and THIRD_PARTY_CODE_AND_LICENSE_REGISTER.md.

---

## Tasks Requiring Control Tower Approval

The following tasks require Artem / Control Tower review before execution:

- Starting T017 (requires CT hosting decision, legal review completion, and explicit CT approval; review `PUBLICATION_RISK_GATE.md` and `HOSTING_OPTION_MATRIX.md` first).
- Starting v0.3 Dataset MVP.
- Implementing any product code (scripts, automated tooling, application features).
- Creating any incident records.
- Selecting incident sources and verifying data licenses.
- Choosing the static site generator technology.
- Any cross-repository changes or integrations.
- Any reuse of third-party code or data.

---

## Blocked Tasks

- v0.3 Dataset MVP — blocked until T006 dossier shortlist is approved.
- Incident record creation — blocked until T006 is approved and workflow gates are passed.
- Any mass import or scraping workflow — blocked unless separately approved.

---

## Cross-Repository Coordination Notes

- Incident export format must be compatible with `caesar-ai-evidence` incident-mapping schema. Maintain compatibility in future schema updates.
- T005 schema/taxonomy files exist; keep changes backward-compatible unless a new decision is approved.
- Future Governance OS integration requires stable incident IDs (INC-0001 format) and taxonomy IDs — locked in v0.2 contract.
- Do not edit `caesar-ai-evidence` or any sibling repository from this repository.
- AIID CC BY-SA 4.0 ShareAlike clause must be reviewed before any direct AIID data import. See `LICENSE_AND_SOURCE_SAFETY_CHECKLIST.md` section 2.1.
